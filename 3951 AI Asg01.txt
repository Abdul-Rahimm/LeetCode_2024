Qs1 --
let's address each question separately:

1. Which objections still carry some weight?

The objection related to consciousness still carries weight. 
Despite advancements in AI, machines lack subjective experience, self-awareness, and true understanding. 
While they can perform tasks that mimic intelligence, the nature of consciousness remains a complex and unresolved issue in the development of AI.

2. Are his refutations valid?

Turing's refutations, particularly in response to objections related to consciousness are valid within the context of his proposed test(imitation). 
Turing emphasized for a focus on observable behavior rather than delving into the metaphysical aspects of consciousness. 
This perspective has influenced the development of AI, emphasizing functional capabilities and measurable outcomes.

3. Can you think of new objections arising from developments since he wrote the paper?

Yes, there are new objections that have arisen listed below.

1. Explainability and Understanding:
Modern AI systems, particularly deep learning models, are often criticized for being black boxes.
While they can provide accurate predictions, explaining the reasoning behind those predictions is challenging. 
The lack of explainability raises concerns in applications where interpretability is crucial.

2. Bias and Ethical Concerns:
AI systems can inherit and even exacerbate biases present in training data. 
This raises ethical concerns regarding fairness and accountability, especially when AI is used in decision-making processes that affect individuals or communities.

4. Do you think Turing's prediction about computers passing a Turing Test by 2000 is reasonable?

Turing's prediction that a computer would have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test by the year 2000 turned out to be overly optimistic.
While significant progress has been made in AI, achieving human-level general intelligence and passing the Turing Test in all its complexity is still not possible. 
The field has seen advancements in specialized AI, 
but the broader understanding and contextual reasoning required for passing a comprehensive Turing Test have proven to be highly challenging.

Qs2 --

1. Playing a decent game of table tennis (ping-pong):
Current Status: Feasible to some extent.
AI has demonstrated proficiency in games like table tennis, particularly with the use of reinforcement learning algorithms. 
Robots equipped with advanced sensors and actuators have shown the ability to play ping-pong at a decent level, 
although they may not yet match the skills of top human players.

2. Driving in the center of Karachi:
Current Status: Challenging.
Autonomous driving technology has made significant strides, 
but navigating complex and dynamic urban environments like the center of Karachi poses substantial challenges. 
Real-world complexities such as diverse traffic scenarios, erratic human drivers,
 and complex road infrastructure make this task currently infeasible for fully autonomous vehicles.

3. Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level:
Current Status: Challenging.
Playing bridge at a competitive level involves complex decision-making, strategic planning, and understanding partner and opponent behavior. 
While AI has excelled in games like chess and Go, bridge presents additional challenges due to its incomplete information nature, 
requiring a deep understanding of human psychology and collaboration. Progress is being made, but reaching a competitive human level remains a difficulty.

4. Discovering and proving new mathematical theorems:
Current Status: Partially feasible.
AI has shown some capability in assisting mathematicians by exploring mathematical spaces and proposing conjectures. 
However, the creativity and intuition required for the discovery and rigorous proof of entirely new theorems are predominantly within the realm of human mathematicians. AI can be a valuable tool but is not a replacement for human insight.

5. Writing an intentionally funny story:
Current Status: Partially feasible.
AI has demonstrated the ability to generate text and even create narratives. 
While it can produce content with humor, generating consistently funny and contextually appropriate stories that resonate with human sensibilities is challenging. 
Humor often involves cultural nuances and context understanding, which AI may struggle to grasp completely.

6. Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law:
Current Status: Limited.
AI systems, including legal expert systems, can provide information and generate basic legal advice within specific domains. 
However, providing competent legal advice in complex and nuanced legal situations requires a deep understanding of legal principles, 
context, and often involves subjective interpretation, which AI may not handle accurately.

7. Translating spoken English into spoken Urdu in real time:
Current Status: Feasible to some extent.
Real-time speech translation systems have been developed, and some are capable of translating spoken English into spoken Urdu with reasonable accuracy. 
However, challenges such as variations in accents, colloquialisms, and context-specific understanding still exist. 
Continuous advancements are being made in this area.

In summary, while AI has made remarkable progress, there are still challenges in handling tasks that require nuanced understanding, 
real-time adaptability to complex environments, or human-like creativity and intuition.
